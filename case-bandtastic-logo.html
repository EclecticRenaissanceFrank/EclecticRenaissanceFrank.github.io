                        I wanted something that had characteristics of calligraphy like the b flat, but without being as complicated as a script typeface.

Serif refers to the tiny little toes that are on the edges of letters like on a typewriter, & the commonly used Times New Roman.

                        I brought it back a little & got some symmetry by placing only the c from Amarante at the end of Bangla & was quite pleased with the results. I thought it looked a bit cleaner with only the flat in front of Bangla MN, but the character & symmetry that the C from Amarante added was too much to resist! I nudged the c down just a couple pixels to line the top of it up with the bottom of the cross on the T, & to dip it below the baseline like the musical flat.
