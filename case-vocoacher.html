          <p class="case-content what">The Pocket VoCoacher was my second project for Bloc.io. I had a better idea about the role of different deliverables & was able to layer what I was working on while waiting for testing results. It took about 3 months to go from the discovery phase to a full MVP prototype. I assumed the roles of Researcher, Strategist, Information Architect, & Visual Designer. I used Sketch for lo-fi wires & the rest of visual design, Draw.io for flows, & used Maze.design to test different iterations of my Invision prototype.</p>

              I had two surveys. One for general demographic & education information, & the other covered features. I did the second survey over two populations, musicians/vocalists, & the general population. Since I wanted the app to apply to practicing vocalists & beginners, I was curious to see how their priorities differed.

              A gamified app was supported by 2 key things from my user research, peoples affinity toward visual learning, & problems with motivation to complete MOOC classes.

              I made a final decision on features by combining the results of the musician's survey & the gen-pop survey. I picked the top 4 & kicked the 2 out that were at the bottom in both surveys. So, that meant no songs, & no range tracking. I REALLY wanted a song section in there since it would've allowed me to design & test the interface for it.

              Well, right off the bat I have to mention Ken Tamplin’s branding. It is very dense. Most of my competition is aesthetically pleasing except for NoteHitter, which is the most value for dollar. None seem to have serious problems with their IA, but Matt Farnsworth’s app seems to have a lot of overlap, & it’s odd that the profile icon leads to his profile. I watched reviews of Rockband 4, & it seems to do the visuals of the vocal accuracy as I’d expect, just in a pastel-neon scheme to mesh with its colorful style. Of course, Rockband is where the gamify influence will come from. All of these products seem exceptionally strong in one or more aspects, yet they all leave something out. The only thing Ken Tamplin leaves out is an app, & I’d assume it would be monumental if it existed.

              Here are the basic visual changes you'll see across all screens. After pref testing my wireframes & seeing box-shaped data win, I added my color & typography. Tested changes continued from 1.2 to 1.4. A color overhaul took place on 1.5 after discussing consistency with my Bloc mentor. 1.6 was an adjustment closer to the Apple HIG. I initially understood the HIG as inspiration like Dribble, but it was explained as a starting point to branch out from.

              I thought blue links would be familiar enough to signal interaction, but people kept pressing the black text on the right. The new user button was added to separate the option from the user picker. RESET STATS was moved here from the Stats screen because it's a highly destructive account altering action. It made sense with the HIG redesign for the Stats screen since FILTER took its place.

              Another thing I did to try & prevent the misclicks during testing was to indent the scale selection. The Sound Picker was dropped after 1.3. I was initially trying to free up some screen real estate, which caused me to consider if it was necessary or not. I posted a quick survey on Reddit which led to removing it.

              The challenge for the Intervals set up was picking the intervals. I initially created sort of an analysis paralysis with too many options. I cleaned up the options, the tables, & added an aesthetically pleasing semi-transparent display of the user's selection.

              The Pitch Accuracy Indicator was included from the beginning to correct pitch in real time. In 1.4 the text on the notes changed when I dropped the sound picker. I think that also solidifies what’s learned by seeing the note that's being sung. For the sheet music problem, looking up sheet music images led to compromise. An app named Yousician actually did their sheet music in a sky blue.

              1.3 added notes in Sheet View & let List View breathe more. An inner shadow was added in 1.4 to draw attention to view selection some people missed during testing. Sheet/List text was stopped from switching sides because it was visually jarring. The proper reload icon was added at the end.

              The Stats screen suffered the most from not knowing the proper role of the HIG. It was hard to deal with 7 filters on one screen. People kept missing filters in testing, but the inner shadow like the Post Training screen added some attention. In 1.5 I shortened the distance in the center to get rid of a perceived middle column. The box on right was an enlarged version of the notes in-game. It’s a visual of note accuracy, & initially there as creative L/R balance to the stats area on the left. It was taken out in 1.6 because it did not fit in the H.I.G. redesign, & didn’t really impact anything.

            The thing that really worked like a charm was my newfound ability to layer what I was working on. In my first project, Bandtastic, I was doing a lot of waiting for enough testing to be completed which took up a lot of time. Since this was my second lap, I felt free to move onto something else which helped a lot on time.
        </p>
        <p class="case-content conclusion-content">
            I really doubted my skill in visual design until I got a bit more familiar with Apple's Human Interface Guidelines.
        </p>
        <p class="case-content conclusion-content">            
            The thing that surprised me the most was musicians not following my Maze test instructions. They seemed more interested in exploring instead of following the path of a user flow.
         </p>
        <p class="case-content conclusion-content">
            I'd add a few things given more time. I'd include a small onboarding process for user name & vocal range so the user could go right into practice. Some Badge/Sticker Awards like XBOX & Playstation do with trophies & achievements would strengthen visual branding & aid in dealing with people’s motivation issues. An option to adjust tempo & note length would be a simple addition for a bit more flexibility, & an option to hide the note names would add to the challenge.
        </p>
        <p class="case-content conclusion-content">
            The most important things I learned, were the proper use of the Human Interface Guidelines, & weakness in remote testing regarding giving directions. I really enjoyed working on this project even though I was in a hurry the whole time. I can't wait to tackle a third project & clean up my process even more.
