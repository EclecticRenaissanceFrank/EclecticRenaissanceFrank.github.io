          <p class="case-content what">The Pocket VoCoacher was my second project for Bloc.io. I had a better idea about the role of different deliverables & was able to layer what I was working on while waiting for testing results. It took about 3 months to go from the discovery phase to a full MVP prototype. I assumed the roles of Researcher, Strategist, Information Architect, & Visual Designer. I used Sketch for lo-fi wires & the rest of visual design, Draw.io for flows, & used maze.design to test different iterations of my Invision prototype.</p>

              I had two surveys. One for general learning information, & the other covered features. I did the second survey over two populations, musicians/vocalists, & the general population. Since I wanted the app to apply to practicing vocalists & beginners, I was curious to see how their priorities differed.

            I made a final decision on features by combining the results of the musicians survey & the gen-pop survey. I picked a top 4 & kicked the 2 out that were at the bottom in both surveys. SO, that means, NO SONGS, & no range tracking.

                    The visual aesthetics...it feels...bland in some way. The color choice feels like a washed out photograph. I don’t really see anything WRONG in particular, it just seems lifeless. I guess it’s weak branding.</li>

              Well, right off the bat I have to mention Ken Tamplin’s branding, bravo sir. Most of these things are aesthetically pleasing except the NoteHitter, which actually seems like the most value for dollar. None seem to have serious problems with their IA, but Matt Farnsworth’s app seems to have a lot of overlap, & it’s way off that the profile icon leads to his profile. Maybe make that an About tab. I watched reviews of Rockband 4, & it seems to do the visuals of the vocal accuracy like I’d expect, just in a pastel-neon scheme to mesh with it’s colorful style. Of course Rockband is where the gamify influence will come from. All of these products seem exceptionally strong in one or more aspects, yet they all leave something out. The only thing Ken Tamplin leaves out is an app, & I’d assume it would be monumental if it existed.

I don’t remember the issue with the smiley face at this time, I just remember it caused confusion & was mentioned a couple times in the early user testing videos. Multiple people thought the B was supposed to be a back button, as it was on the top/left corner of the screen where a back button conventionally goes. I remember watching my users struggle & putting my hands on my head like I just blew up the chemistry lab. It was the first time I caught a mistake through user testing.

They were changed to what I now know as conventional looking icons for map, filter, & sort. They still weren’t popping, so I decided to change the top to my Mega Man blue.

              I also learned about Atomic Design & made a little system. It definitely helped when adding or editing multiple elements.

            The thing that really worked like a charm was my newfound ability to layer what I was working on. In my first project, Bandtastic, I was doing a lot of waiting for enough testing to be completed which took up a lot of time. Since this was my second lap, I felt free to move onto something else which helped a lot on time.

            I really doubted my skill in visual design until I got a bit more familiar with Apple's Human Interface Guidelines.
            
            The thing that surprised me the most was musicians not following my Maze test instructions. They seemed more interested in exploring instead of following the path of a user flow.

            I'd add a few things given more time. I'd include a small onboarding process for user name & vocal range so the user could go right into practice. Some Badge/Sticker Awards like XBOX & Playstation do with trophies & achievements would strengthen visual branding & aid in dealing with people’s motivation issues. Finally, an option to adjust tempo & note length would be a simple addition for a bit more flexibility.

            The most important things I learned, were the proper use of the Human Interface Guidelines, & the weakness of remote testing.
