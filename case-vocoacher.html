          <p class="case-content what">The Pocket VoCoacher was my second project for Bloc.io. I had a better idea about the role of different deliverables & was able to layer what I was working on while waiting for testing results. It took about 3 months to go from the discovery phase to a full MVP prototype. I assumed the roles of Researcher, Strategist, Information Architect, & Visual Designer. I used Sketch for lo-fi wires & the rest of visual design, Draw.io for flows, & used maze.design to test different iterations of my Invision prototype.</p>

            I had to play the role of my stakeholders, so I basically interviewed myself.

              I had two surveys. One for general demographic & education information, & the other covered features. I did the second survey over two populations, musicians/vocalists, & the general population. Since I wanted the app to apply to practicing vocalists & beginners, I was curious to see how their priorities differed.

              I made a final decision on features by combining the results of the musicians survey & the gen-pop survey. I picked a top 4 & kicked the 2 out that were at the bottom in both surveys. So, that meant no songs, & no range tracking. I REALLY wanted a song section in there since it would've allowed me to design & test the interface for it.

                    The visual aesthetics...it feels...bland in some way. The color choice feels like a washed out photograph. I don’t really see anything WRONG in particular, it just seems lifeless. I guess it’s weak branding.</li>

                    This app is where I was slapped in the face with the importance of a visual pitch indicator. It was frustrating hitting 5 or 6 notes in a row, missing one, & then getting WAY off from where the key was. Maybe it's because I'm a self-taught vocalist & I survive through chaining intervals, but this got me to stop using the app & return to just singing songs.</li>

                    They should add more exercises. For the way they have this arranged, it would multiply the possibilities of the app with very little effort</li>

              Well, right off the bat I have to mention Ken Tamplin’s branding, bravo sir. Most of my competition is aesthetically pleasing except for NoteHitter, which actually seems like the most value for dollar. None seem to have serious problems with their IA, but Matt Farnsworth’s app seems to have a lot of overlap, & it’s way off that the profile icon leads to his profile. Maybe make that an About tab. I watched reviews of Rockband 4, & it seems to do the visuals of the vocal accuracy like I’d expect, just in a pastel-neon scheme to mesh with it’s colorful style. Of course Rockband is where the gamify influence will come from. All of these products seem exceptionally strong in one or more aspects, yet they all leave something out. The only thing Ken Tamplin leaves out is an app, & I’d assume it would be monumental if it existed.

              When I went through my first round of tests with my initial mockup, I realized my icons didn’t stand out enough for the map/filter/sort, as they were simple circles. I’m still learning & didn’t see this as a problem since my labels were very clear, but the icons needed their own way of demanding attention. They were changed to what I now know as conventional looking icons for map, filter, & sort. They still weren’t popping, so I decided to change the top to my Mega Man blue.

                I also saw that many sites used a grey color for their bottom navigation, so I decided to follow in suit. I was happy with it, as I saw that it made the highlighted text/icons stand out more. I left the bottom as the baby blue color, but I made the blue less intense & more grey so the blue highlight for icons & text stood out a bit more.

            <p class="case-content visual-design project-bandtastic-icon-issuesMid2 mar-horz5">
                I added attention & readability to the text by slightly increasing the size, & weighting it medium vs the regular weight that it was before. I also made the text my light black color vs the medium grey that the icons were. The selected icon & text were both Mega Man Blue & the selected text was bold.

              Around this time I also decided to keep the search results displayed at the top so the user could see what they searched for. The X would allow them to search again without having to press the search icon as I’d had before.

            The thing that really worked like a charm was my newfound ability to layer what I was working on. In my first project, Bandtastic, I was doing a lot of waiting for enough testing to be completed which took up a lot of time. Since this was my second lap, I felt free to move onto something else which helped a lot on time.

            I really doubted my skill in visual design until I got a bit more familiar with Apple's Human Interface Guidelines.
            
            The thing that surprised me the most was musicians not following my Maze test instructions. They seemed more interested in exploring instead of following the path of a user flow.

            I'd add a few things given more time. I'd include a small onboarding process for user name & vocal range so the user could go right into practice. Some Badge/Sticker Awards like XBOX & Playstation do with trophies & achievements would strengthen visual branding & aid in dealing with people’s motivation issues. An option to adjust tempo & note length would be a simple addition for a bit more flexibility, & an option to hide the note names would add to the challenge.

            The most important things I learned, were the proper use of the Human Interface Guidelines, & weakness in remote testing regarding giving directions.
