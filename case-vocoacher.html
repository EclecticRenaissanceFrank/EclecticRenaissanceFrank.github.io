          <p class="case-content what">The Pocket VoCoacher was my second project for Bloc.io. I had a better idea about the role of different deliverables & was able to layer what I was working on while waiting for testing results. It took about 3 months to go from the discovery phase to a full MVP prototype. I assumed the roles of Researcher, Strategist, Information Architect, & Visual Designer. I used Sketch for lo-fi wires & the rest of visual design, Draw.io for flows, & used maze.design to test different iterations of my Invision prototype.</p>

          <p class="case-content problem">I needed to position a vocal training app against my competitors by balancing gamefied type look & feel, & level of professionalism.</p>

            I had to play the role of my stakeholders, so I basically interviewed myself. I found a bunch of tips & questions compiled from multiple sites about <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bzKudPBLs8edX3LnJagyo7lcVGhLblYuT6ZX4r7-wgY/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Stakeholder Interviews</a>, & answered them to create the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WN02DZFU7kTSpVZ8D_UcI6Ijh9KvK9DXmUpAeJ15xqE/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Business Requirements</a> document.

              I had two surveys. One for general demographic & education information, & the other covered features. I did the second survey over two populations, musicians/vocalists, & the general population. Since I wanted the app to apply to practicing vocalists & beginners, I was curious to see how their priorities differed.

              I made a final decision on features by combining the results of the musicians survey & the gen-pop survey. I picked the top 4 & kicked the 2 out that were at the bottom in both surveys. So, that meant no songs, & no range tracking. I REALLY wanted a song section in there since it would've allowed me to design & test the interface for it.

                    The visual aesthetics...it feels...bland in some way. The color choice feels like a washed out photograph. I don’t really see anything WRONG in particular, it just seems lifeless. I guess it’s weak branding.</li>

                    This app is where I was slapped in the face with the importance of a visual pitch indicator. It was frustrating hitting 5 or 6 notes in a row, missing one, & then getting WAY off from where the key was. Maybe it's because I'm a self-taught vocalist & I survive through chaining intervals, but this got me to stop using the app & return to just singing songs.</li>

                    They should add more exercises. For the way they have this arranged, it would multiply the possibilities of the app with very little effort</li>

              Well, right off the bat I have to mention Ken Tamplin’s branding, bravo sir. Most of my competition is aesthetically pleasing except for NoteHitter, which actually seems like the most value for dollar. None seem to have serious problems with their IA, but Matt Farnsworth’s app seems to have a lot of overlap, & it’s way off that the profile icon leads to his profile. Maybe make that an About tab. I watched reviews of Rockband 4, & it seems to do the visuals of the vocal accuracy like I’d expect, just in a pastel-neon scheme to mesh with it’s colorful style. Of course Rockband is where the gamify influence will come from. All of these products seem exceptionally strong in one or more aspects, yet they all leave something out. The only thing Ken Tamplin leaves out is an app, & I’d assume it would be monumental if it existed.

These user stories really come from the MVP formed through my surveys, & the personas seem injected between those two. I can see personas as an empathy exercise which is beneficial in it's own way, but it seems it’s supposed to be more than that. This will be on my radar in the future & I will definitely be asking more experienced team members for advice. I still designed the personas to be busy people that needed a tight yet robust app. My user stories &

              Here are the basic visual changes you'll see across all screens. After pref testing my wireframes & seeing box shaped data win, I added my color & typography. Tested changes continued from 1.2 to 1.4. 1.5 consisted of a color overhaul after discussing consistency with my Bloc mentor. 1.6 was an adjustment closer to the Apple HIG. I initially understood the HIG as inspiration like Dribble, but it was explained as a starting point to branch out from.

Pitch Accuracy Indicator: Because “Note Hitter” was maddening without one. Emulates pitch corrections
1.4 Text on notes changed when I dropped the sound picker. I think that also solidifies what’s learned through training by seeing the note being sung.
For the sheet music problem, Looking up sheet music images led to compromise. An app named YouSician atually did it like this in a sky blue.

Initial Wireframe PrefTest had SHARE on bottom-left for Thumb Friendly Version, not shown...BOX WON.
1.2-1.3 added notes in Sheet View. Let List View breathe more.
1.4 Indented Bar to draw attention to view selection some missed. Stopped Sheet/List text from switching sides.
1.6 realized icon was RELOAD instead of SWITCH

Generally stayed same, 1.3 added posting screen.

              Stats: suffered the most from not knowing the proper role of the HIG. It was hard to deal with 7 filters on one screen.
Initial PrefTest grouped into 3 rows, closest to box shape.
BOX on right of screens was an enlarged version of the notes in game. It’s a visual of note accuracy grading, & initially there as creative L/R balance. It was taken out in 1.6 because it did not fit in the H.I.G. redesign, & didn’t impact anything.
Since people kept missing filters in testing…. indented bar like Post Training Sheet/List Views.
1.5 Mentor note on too much space between columns, making it appear like a center column existed.
HIG in 1.6 GREATLY simplified this screen.

        <p class="case-content conclusion-content">
            The thing that really worked like a charm was my newfound ability to layer what I was working on. In my first project, Bandtastic, I was doing a lot of waiting for enough testing to be completed which took up a lot of time. Since this was my second lap, I felt free to move onto something else which helped a lot on time.
        </p>
        <p class="case-content conclusion-content">
            I really doubted my skill in visual design until I got a bit more familiar with Apple's Human Interface Guidelines.
        </p>
        <p class="case-content conclusion-content">            
            The thing that surprised me the most was musicians not following my Maze test instructions. They seemed more interested in exploring instead of following the path of a user flow.
         </p>
        <p class="case-content conclusion-content">
            I'd add a few things given more time. I'd include a small onboarding process for user name & vocal range so the user could go right into practice. Some Badge/Sticker Awards like XBOX & Playstation do with trophies & achievements would strengthen visual branding & aid in dealing with people’s motivation issues. An option to adjust tempo & note length would be a simple addition for a bit more flexibility, & an option to hide the note names would add to the challenge.
        </p>
        <p class="case-content conclusion-content">
            The most important things I learned, were the proper use of the Human Interface Guidelines, & weakness in remote testing regarding giving directions.
