          <p class="case-content what">Bandtastic was my first project for Bloc.io. I was at my most disheveled, but I sure learned from the experience. I wasn't aware of how much I needed to document discoveries or maintain deliverables at this point, & I was really wrapped up in observing the role of different deliverables & how they worked together. It took about 7-8 months to go from the discovery phase to a working prototype.</p>

          <p class="case-content what">Bandtastic combines the ecommerce aspect of Craigslist & eBay, with the social media aspect of Myspace & Band Mix. I assumed the roles of Researcher, Strategist, Information Architect, & Visual Designer. I used Sketch, Balsamiq for lo-fi wires, Draw.io for flows, a handful of tools Google offers, & UserTesting.com provided videos of people testing the prototype.</p>

              Craigslist

              Very organized for so much text
              About as good a use of whitespace as they can manage

              Because there are SO many things to categorize & it's done in such a tight space, it seems inescapably cluttered.
              The look can be described as "cheap". Perhaps it’s light to favor quick loading times on mobile.

              The use of dropdown menus could help the clutter

              The news tiles on the landing page are just...endless, & seem randomly arranged
              The Sign In/Up, & Search function whiting out the whole page is jarring.
              The album search can't combine "new releases/high rotation" with the genre choice.

              I can scroll through the landing page very quickly & parse information properly. It's very clean & organized.
              Navigation is very simple & quick.
              Search has categories & subcategories.
              Obvious hero
              Colors of buttons leave them easy to spot
              Excellent use of whitespace to separate product/info.

              Craigslist is very plain & is basically a want ad. Their map seems like an afterthought. eBay has the used sales portion down, but it’s not targeting musicians. MySpace is basically musical advertising now, & BandMix is social media for musicians that want to become band members. Each also had aesthetic strengths I could pull from. All were well organized except MySpace, they all used white space well, & all but Craigslist had buttons that were easy to spot.

            WireHeader Mistake
            I was pretty surprised when it confused people. I don’t remember the issue with the smiley face at this time, I just remember it caused confusion & was mentioned a couple times in the early user testing videos. Multiple people thought the B was supposed to be a back button, as it was on the top/left corner of the screen where a back button conventionally goes. I remember watching my users struggle & putting my hands on my head like I just blew up the chemistry lab. It was the first time I caught a mistake through user testing.

              I threw together a logo to put in place of the B. I wanted something inviting & musical, so I decided on a hand with instrument fingers, & a b-flat in the center of the palm. I meant to revisit the idea to clean it up but did not get a chance. I did however, see how it could e altered to fit on different color backgrounds.
