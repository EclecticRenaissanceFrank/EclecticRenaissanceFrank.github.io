          <p class="case-content what">Bandtastic was my first project. 
              It combines the ecommerce aspect of Craigslist & eBay, 
              & the social media aspect of Myspace & Band Mix, 
              with a focus on connecting musicians locally.
              I assumed the roles of Researcher, Content Strategist, 
              Information Architect, & Visual Designer.----------------What Content - What you do - NOT a summary - This app does this - What roles did you accept? - Deliverales? - Did you do ALL Visual Design or just UI work? - Tools?: CSS HTML Sketch Google Forms - BG of client/company - why they chose you.</p>

          <p class="case-content discovery strategy">
              After conducting some research through survey, I found that people wanted an app that dealt with buying & selling used gear, renting gear, & that they were wary of scammers on eBay & Craigslist. An early idea was a rating system for that exact purpose but was out of the scope of the core product for now, as were rentals. The MVP focused on adding your own gear to the market, searching, & the checkout process. - - - - - - - - -

              Competitive Analysis (SWOT)


              Analyzing my competition so I could position the app properly went off without a hitch. This was more objective, so it was no trouble to see where Bandtastic could fit in. Craigslist is very plain & is basically a want ad, & their map seems like a very plain looking afterthought. eBay has the used sales portion down, but it’s not targeting musicians. MySpace is basically musical advertising now, & BandMix is social media for musicians that want to become band members. They also each had aesthetic strengths that I could pull from. All were well organized except MySpace, used white space well, & all but Craigslist had buttons that were easy to spot.

              User Research Analysis
              Personas

              Personas were a nice way of making sure I covered a wide range of musicians with Bandtastic. Regardless of the age, location, musical genre, & experience level, I wanted to make sure that Bandtastic was appropriate & accessable.

              It was also new to me to try & consider the motivations of different types of musicians. A touring independant musician & a music teacher would both potentially need to find some used gear, albeit for their own reasons.

              User Stories Flows

  In order to get ready for wireframing, I started with some user stories, & then translated them into user flows. They really helped me begin & project a pathway for the app.
  
  Balsamiq Wireframes

  I built my wireframes in Balsamiq but I think next time I’ll just do it in Sketch since I’m much more comfortable with that program now than I was at this time in the project.
  One mistake I made is that I glazed over the placeholders for my logo & user avatar in the top navigation. I used a B in a circle for the bandtastic logo & a smiley face where the user avatar would go. I made the decision very flippantly since these wireframes were for information architecture & that was in the forefront of my mind. 

  WireHeader Mistake
  I was pretty surprised when it confused people. I don’t remember the issue with the smiley face at this time, I just remember it caused confusion & was mentioned a couple times in the early user testing videos. Multiple people thought the B was supposed to be a back button, as it was on the top/left corner of the screen where a back button conventionally goes. I remember watching my users struggle & putting my hands on my head like I just blew up the school’s chemistry lab or something.
