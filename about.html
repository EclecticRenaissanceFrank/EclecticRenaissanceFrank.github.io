					Frank Mooradian...pronounced Moo-rah-dee-inn, as it’s an Armenian last name.  Don’t self-flagellate too much now!  I’ve also accepted Mer-ray-dee-ann & Mer-rid-ee-inn like the Prime Meridian.  I’ve had an unorthodox trip to design & as of right now, I’m in the middle of pivoting into an exponential success curve.  Fail fast, fail forward.

					I didn’t attend much college, but I’ve been an autodidact long before I even knew the word existed.  I began teaching myself drums at the age of 17.  Guitar & singing soon followed.  I acquired an ACE Personal Trainer certification at 20 so I knew how to exercise properly.  I finished the Basic Improv Program at Second City Chicago in 2009.  It’s around this time that the seeds of the educational internet began sprouting.</div>

					<div class="grid-bio-content">
					I suppose I stumbled onto Personal Development accidentally.  I felt lacking in general, & had trouble approaching women.  Pick up artists seemed distasteful & full of nonsense gimmicks.  One anomaly named Eban Pagan, claimed that you needed to transform your character into the man you wanted to be, & you would naturally radiate to who you want to attract.  This resonated with me on a deep level.</div>

					<div class="grid-bio-content">
					Thus began the slow death of TV for me, which was inverse to the gradual increase of my... autodidacticism?... being an autodidactician?  I basically threw information at myself & expected my innate pattern recognition ability to pick up the most important concepts.  I can’t tell you what epistemological or ontological arguments are, but I’ve listened to philosophy audiobooks of the greats & subscribe to a few podcasts.  I’d probably be somewhat lost in a roundtable discussion full of expert economists, but I do know the basics of supply & demand, taxing vs subsidizing, subjective value theory, & the distortion of market signals by the Federal Reserve.  Related to the Conscious Capitalism concept of providing value, I’ve heard I should provide twice what I’m paid.  If I’m making 100K a year, I should be bringing 200K in value.</div>

					<div class="grid-bio-content">
					Even though I don't really plan to open a business, I still went through MBA In A Box.  I have a Project Management class in my Udemy queue.  I want to understand the satellite jobs around me & the mindset of success through entrepreneurs.  Tai Lopez 67 Steps was a condensed intro, & I love Gary Vaynerchuk, Patrick Bet-David, Dan Lok, & the tough love of Dan Pena.  I’m currently smashing through Real Estate Investor information through multiple podcasts & the Bigger Pockets community.</div>

					It was a near act of god how I came into being a UX Designer.  My tenacity & existing momentum of self-education led me to sporadically learning enough about psychology over 7 years to perform a method of trauma processing on myself.  It cleared away a subconscious belief that had been manifesting as freezing+brain fog for about 16 years.  I tested the conditions I had previously frozen in...all clear.  Heavy. The smelling salts of optimism fueled a new 15 year strategy to financial independence.  My recommended reading on trauma processing is The Body Keeps The Score</div>

					<div class="grid-bio-content">
					My apprenticeship at Bloc was the first step of my pivot after that was taken care of.  I essentially needed a job that paid well, had high availability, was somewhat future proof, & was affordable.  After about a month of intense research...UX Designer through Bloc.io checked all my required boxes.  I was actually able to afford it, by delivering Jimmy Johns on a scooter in south Florida, & getting 70 mpg.</div>

					<div class="grid-bio-content">
					What messily fell into place over the next 2 years was a somewhat arbitrarily found diamond in the rough.  The UX problem solving process made absolute sense to me once I understood how it all fit together.  It helped me contemplate strategy more, & it’s directly tied to my personal development.  User Research helps me focus on the needs of others after focusing on myself for so long.  It broke me out of the tentacles of perfection & merged what I had learned about failure=learning from listening to entrepreneurs with tests & iterations.  Bloc is constantly user testing itself & iterating, so it was different upon leaving compared to when I started.  While college seemed wasteful, Bloc was lean. I’m proud to have it be part of my intellectual Jeet Kun Do.</div>

					I’ll be looking for a holistic Pareto Principle.  Specifically for my UX career, I’d like to always have a degree of generalizing, with a concentration in Research & Information Architecture, as research is for personal development, & IA matches my personality.  Aside from improving the skill of my career, I’m aware of improving the skill of having a career.  I’m looking to learn teamwork dynamic, communication channels, & to assist each other as mentors in a Mastermind Group.</div>
					
					<div class="grid-bio-content">
					Entrepreneurs talk of creating systems of success, & I’ll be looking to create systems within systems.  The more efficient I am inside my career, the more streamlined I can make outside my career, as time is limited.  Aside from practice, I’ll be looking to invent a sub-genre of music, record, & leverage Saavy Musician Academy.  I’ll be attending Windy City Wing Chun & supplementing with EnterShaolin.com.  I’ll be running the numbers on 1 Real Estate deal a night for a year in preparation for my first “House Hack” & to learn the classes of Chicago neighborhoods.  Saturday is friends or date night.  Sundays are my days for REIA or tech meetups, & Second City has a free Improv drop-in around 7 last I checked.</div>
					
					<div class="grid-bio-content">
					All this activity now is due to not having much of a strategy in my 20’s, yet bringing forward what I love.  A great thing about Chicago is The L.  Hopefully, I can do all of this without a car.  If not, I’ll get the common millionaire car, an 8 year old Ford F150.</div>
