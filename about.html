					Frank Mooradian...pronounced Moo-rah-dee-inn, as it’s an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenia" target="_blank">Armenian</a> last name.  Don’t self-flagellate too much now!  I’ve also accepted Mer-ray-dee-ann & Mer-rid-ee-inn like the Prime Meridian.  I’ve had an unorthodox trip to design & as of right now, I’m attempting to pivot into an exponential success curve.

						I didn’t attend much college, but I’ve been consistently learning & creating for quite some time.  I began teaching myself drums/guitar/vocals at the age of 17, & acquired an ACE Personal Trainer certification at 20 so I knew proper form. That was pre-internet-MOOC days. I finished the Basic Improv Program at <a href="https://www.secondcity.com/" target="_blank">Second City Chicago</a> in 2009, right around when the seeds of internet based education began sprouting.
					</div>

					<div class="grid-bio-content">
						I suppose I stumbled onto <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_development" target="_blank">Personal Development</a> accidentally.  Around 23 I felt lack in general, & had trouble approaching women.  Pick up artists generally seemed distasteful, but one anomaly named Eban Pagan claimed that you needed to transform your character into the man you wanted to be. Then, you would naturally radiate to who you want to attract. That resonated with me on a deep level.
					</div>

					<div class="grid-bio-content">
						Thus began the slow death of TV for me, inverse to the gradual increase of self education. I basically bathed in the information of whatever interested me.  Philosophy audiobooks & podcasts, <a href="https://www.intelligencesquaredus.org/" target="_blank">Intelligence Squared</a> for Oxford style debates, investor podcasts & kindle books. Random little things that have come across my way like MBA In A Box, or a Project Management class in my Udemy queue. I loved learning about the mindset of success through entrepreneurs.  <a href="https://www.the67steps.com/" target="_blank">Tai Lopez 67 Steps</a> was a condensed intro, & I love Gary Vaynerchuk, Patrick Bet-David, Dan Lok, & the tough love of Dan Pena.  I’m currently smashing through Real Estate Investor information through multiple podcasts, books, & the <a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com" target="_blank">Bigger Pockets</a> community.

						Becomming a UX Designer was somewhat of a miracle for me.  My journey through personal development led me to processing some trauma.  Essentially, I looked at life & relationships differently after that.  It's funny how that works.  Soon after that I sat down & planned a 15 year strategy to financial independence.  My recommended reading on trauma processing is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Body-Keeps-Score-Healing-Trauma-ebook/dp/B00G3L1C2K" target="_blank">The Body Keeps The Score</a>.
					</div>

					<div class="grid-bio-content">
						Education was the first step in my pivot plan.  I needed a fulfilling job that was in demand, somewhat future proof, had affordable training, who's pay would be the financial fuel of my investments.  After about a month of intense research, <a href="https://www.bloc.io" target="_blank">Bloc's Designer Track</a> checked all my required boxes.  I was actually able to afford it, by delivering Jimmy Johns <a href="http://powersports.honda.com/2018/pcx.aspx" target="_blank">on a scooter</a> in south Florida, which cut my expenses by getting 70 mpg.
					</div>

					<div class="grid-bio-content">
						What messily fell into place as I attended Bloc, was a somewhat arbitrarily found diamond in the rough.  The UX problem solving process made absolute sense to me once I fit it all together.  It led to me contemplating strategy more, & it’s directly tied to my personal development.  User Research helps me focus on the needs of others after focusing strictly on problems that were rooted in trauma for so long.  User testing & iteration broke me out of the tentacles of perfection by making me experience the "failure=learning" concept I've heard from so many entrepreneurs.  Bloc also user tests itself & iterates, so it was different upon leaving compared to when I started. I’m proud to have it be part of my mental Jeet Kun Do.

						I’m aiming for a holistic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle" target="_blank">Pareto Principle</a>. Aside from improving the skill of UX Designer, I’m aware of improving the skill of having a career. I’m looking to learn teamwork dynamic, communication channels, & to assist each other as mentors in a <a href="https://www.thesuccessalliance.com/what-is-a-mastermind-group/" target="_blank">Mastermind Group</a>. The more efficient I am inside my career, the more time & mental energy I have on everything else involving creativity & discipline.
					</div>
						
					<div class="grid-bio-content">
						  Aside from practice, I’ll be looking to invent a sub-genre of music, record, & leverage <a href="https://savvymusicianacademy.com/" target="_blank">Saavy Musician Academy</a>.  I’ll be attending <a href="http://www.windycitywingchun.com" target="_blank">Windy City Wing Chun</a> & supplementing with <a href="https://entershaolin.com/" target="_blank">EnterShaolin.com</a>.  I’ll be running the numbers on 1 Real Estate deal a night for a year in preparation for my first “House Hack” & to learn the classes of Chicago neighborhoods.  Saturday is anything-social night.  Sundays are my days for REIA or tech meetups, <a href="https://draxe.com/sensory-deprivation-tank/" target="_blank">Float Tanks</a>, & <a href="https://trainingcenter.secondcity.com/s/sc-class-category/a2g1H000000Xw04QAC/improv-dropins" target="_blank">Second City</a> has an Improv drop-in around 7.

					<div class="grid-bio-content">
						So that's what entrepreneur stuffs + artistic stuffs looks like, for me ayways. I'm going to try to do this without a car using Chicago's L train so I can save more to invest. I can also get some kindle or podcast action while I'm on the train, so more education time. Here's to living to 200!
