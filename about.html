					Hello! I'm Frank Mooradian...pronounced Moo-rah-dee-inn, as it’s an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenia" target="_blank">Armenian</a> last name.  Don’t worry if you mispronounce it.  I’ve also accepted what sounds like our globes Prime Meridian.  I’ve had a pretty unorthodox journey to design.

						I’ve been consistently learning & creating for quite some time.  I began teaching myself drums guitar & vocals at the age of 17.  I acquired an ACE Personal Trainer certification at 20 so I knew proper form, & finished a fun exercise in teamwork, the <a href="https://www.secondcity.com/" target="_blank">Second City Chicago</a>'s Basic Improv Program, shortly after.

						I stumbled onto <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_development" target="_blank">Personal Development</a> accidentally, & it changed the trajectory of my life.  As the internet matured, there was always SOME way to get my hands on something to learn.  Audiobooks, podcasts, Kindle, & Youtube, all contain fantastic content.  I'm into many things including philosophy, content from entrepreneurs, biohacking, real estate investing, & every now & then I'll watch an <a href="https://www.intelligencesquaredus.org/" target="_blank">Intelligence Squared</a> Oxford style debate.

						Becoming a UX Designer was somewhat of a miracle.  My journey through personal development led me to looking at life differently, & to forming a 15 year plan.  Education was the first step in my pivot plan, & <a href="https://www.bloc.io" target="_blank">Bloc's Designer Track</a> nailed all my requirements for a path to a fulfilling career.

                        The UX problem solving process made absolute sense to me once I fit it all together.  It led to me contemplating strategy in life more. User testing & iterating refreshingly matched the pattern of personal development.  What I'm most interested in now, is Information Architecture.

                        I’m aiming for a holistic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle" target="_blank">Pareto Principle</a>.  The more efficient I am inside my career, the more time & mental energy I have on everything else involving creativity & discipline.  The fastest way to gain skill seems like learning & teaching my team as a <a href="https://www.thesuccessalliance.com/what-is-a-mastermind-group/" target="_blank">Mastermind Group</a> would do. These unprecedented times have pushed me to focus on remote opportunities, AND have pushed the conversation about remote advantages forward as well. Here's to living to 200!
